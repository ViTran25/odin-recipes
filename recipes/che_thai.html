        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Colorful, sweet, refreshing, and filled with fun textures only begin to describe my all-time favorite Vietnamese dessert Che Thai. Made with jackfruit, lychees, longan, pandan jelly, and red rubies, you can taste the Southeast Asian rainbow with this crowd-pleaser dessert.</p>
        <p>Che Thai is the perfect dessert to make for events hosting large groups of people. It is lightly sweet, filled with delicious tropical fruit, and so refreshing on a hot day.</p>
        <!--Ingredients-->
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>AGAR JELLY</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Agar-agar:</strong> agar is a vegetarian gelatin substitute that helps solidify the simple syrup and creates a subtly sweet jelly texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Granulated Sugar:</strong> sweetens the agar jelly</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>RED RUBIES</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Whole water chestnuts:</strong> make sure to use whole water chestnuts and not use pre-diced water chestnuts since they will not have that same amount of crunch.</li>
            <li><strong>Red food coloring:</strong> the red food coloring is what gives the water chestnuts its “ruby color”</li>
            <li><strong>Tapioca starch:</strong> tapioca starch creates a chewy clear layer around the water chestnuts that mimic a pomegranate.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>PANDAN JELLY (CENDOL)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mung Bean Flour:</strong> mung bean flour or mung bean starch is the base of the pandan jelly.</li>
            <li><strong>Tapioca Starch:</strong> tapioca starch or tapioca flour gives the pandan jelly a nice chewy texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Rice Flour:</strong> rice flour thickens the jelly and also aids in its chewy texture. Do not mistake rice flour for glutinous rice flour it is not the same.</li>
            <li><strong>Pandan Extract:</strong> pandan extract gives the jelly a subtle pandan vanilla flavor and a bright vibrant green color.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>COCONUT HALF & HALF BASE</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Coconut milk:</strong> I recommend using Chef's choice coconut milk for the best tasting coconut milk. The coconut milk will be thickened with tapioca starch and flavored with sugar and salt.</li>
            <li><strong>Half and Half:</strong> half and half is the main base of this dessert. It is what makes che thai creamy and lightens all the sugars from the syrup.</li>
            <li><strong>Palm Sugar:</strong> palm sugar is used for the palm sugar simple syrup that is used to create an additional sweetness to the coconut milk.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>CANNED FRUIT</h3>
        <p>Below I've listed the canned fruit that you need for this che thai recipe. I recommend finding them in an Asian grocery store before buying online since it's a lot more cost-efficient in-store.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lychee</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Jackfruit</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Longan</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Toddy palm seeds</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Canned coconut jelly</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Canned pineapple jelly</strong></li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>AGAR JELLY</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a small saucepan, mix 2 teaspoons agar, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and 1 ¾ cup water and mix on high until it dissolves and reaches a boil. Once it reaches a boil, pour it into a shallow bowl and set it aside until it hardens.</li>
                <li>Once it hardens, thinly slice into ¼ inch strips.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>RED RUBIES</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare the water chestnuts.</strong> In a medium-sized bowl, add the diced water chestnuts and red food coloring. Mix until all the pieces are red. Then add the tapioca starch and toss until fully coated.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook the red rubies.</strong> Boil water in a small saucepan. Then add the coated water chestnuts into the boiling water and stir to prevent them from sticking. Boil for about 2-3 minutes until it floats and has puffed out slightly. Then scoop it all out with a slotted spoon or spider strainer and immediately place it in an ice bath for about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside in a small bowl.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>PANDAN JELLY (CENDOL)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Mix the batter.</strong> In a medium saucepan, mix together the mung bean starch, tapioca starch, rice flour, and water until combined. Then add in 1 teaspoon of pandan extract and stir until combined.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook until thickened.</strong> Cook on high heat and continuously stir until it reaches a boil and some pieces begin to cook underneath and small dark translucent pieces come to the top, about 3 minutes. Then turn the heat to low and keep stirring until it is thick, slightly translucent, and begins to bubble for about 3 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Mold worms.</strong> Using the ¼ inch circles setting on your mashed potato ricer, pour a few scoops into the ricer and squeeze the green worms over a bowl of ice water. Let it steep for about 10 minutes. Drain and aside in a medium bowl.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>COCONUT MILK</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Make tapioca slurry.</strong> In a small bowl, mix together the tapioca starch and 2 tablespoons of water until combined.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook the coconut milk.</strong> In a medium saucepan, add the tapioca slurry, coconut milk, water, salt, and sugar and mix to combine. Heat on medium-high heat and stir until thickened. Then, set aside to cool.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>PALM SUGAR SIMPLE SYRUP</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Make the palm sugar simple syrup.</strong> In a small saucepan, heat the palm sugar and 1 cup of water until the sugar is dissolved. Set aside to cool.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>ASSEMBLY</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cut the fruit.</strong> Cut the jackfruit into small strips and thinly slice the toddy palm seeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Mix together.</strong> In a large mixing bowl, mix together the sliced sugar jelly, lychee with ⅔ cup of syrup, longan with ⅔ cup of syrup, jackfruit with ⅔ cup of syrup, pineapple jelly jar with all the syrup, coconut jelly jar with all the syrup, coconut strings, and sliced toddy palm seeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Assemble.</strong> In a tall glass, add 1-2 ladles of the fruit mixture, 1 scoop of the red rubies, 1 scoop of green worms, ¼ cup of coconut milk, ice, and 1-2 tablespoons of palm sugar simple syrup to taste.</li>
