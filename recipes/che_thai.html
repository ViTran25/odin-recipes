        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Colorful, sweet, refreshing, and filled with fun textures only begin to describe my all-time favorite Vietnamese dessert Che Thai. Made with jackfruit, lychees, longan, pandan jelly, and red rubies, you can taste the Southeast Asian rainbow with this crowd-pleaser dessert.</p>
        <p>Che Thai is the perfect dessert to make for events hosting large groups of people. It is lightly sweet, filled with delicious tropical fruit, and so refreshing on a hot day.</p>
        <!--Ingredients-->
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>AGAR JELLY</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Agar-agar:</strong> agar is a vegetarian gelatin substitute that helps solidify the simple syrup and creates a subtly sweet jelly texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Granulated Sugar:</strong> sweetens the agar jelly</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>RED RUBIES</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Whole water chestnuts:</strong> make sure to use whole water chestnuts and not use pre-diced water chestnuts since they will not have that same amount of crunch.</li>
            <li><strong>Red food coloring:</strong> the red food coloring is what gives the water chestnuts its “ruby color”</li>
            <li><strong>Tapioca starch:</strong> tapioca starch creates a chewy clear layer around the water chestnuts that mimic a pomegranate.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>PANDAN JELLY (CENDOL)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mung Bean Flour:</strong> mung bean flour or mung bean starch is the base of the pandan jelly.</li>
            <li><strong>Tapioca Starch:</strong> tapioca starch or tapioca flour gives the pandan jelly a nice chewy texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Rice Flour:</strong> rice flour thickens the jelly and also aids in its chewy texture. Do not mistake rice flour for glutinous rice flour it is not the same.</li>
            <li><strong>Pandan Extract:</strong> pandan extract gives the jelly a subtle pandan vanilla flavor and a bright vibrant green color.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>COCONUT HALF & HALF BASE</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Coconut milk:</strong> I recommend using Chef's choice coconut milk for the best tasting coconut milk. The coconut milk will be thickened with tapioca starch and flavored with sugar and salt.</li>
            <li><strong>Half and Half:</strong> half and half is the main base of this dessert. It is what makes che thai creamy and lightens all the sugars from the syrup.</li>
            <li><strong>Palm Sugar:</strong> palm sugar is used for the palm sugar simple syrup that is used to create an additional sweetness to the coconut milk.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>CANNED FRUIT</h3>
        <p>Below I've listed the canned fruit that you need for this che thai recipe. I recommend finding them in an Asian grocery store before buying online since it's a lot more cost-efficient in-store.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lychee</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Jackfruit</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Longan</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Toddy palm seeds</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Canned coconut jelly</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Canned pineapple jelly</strong></li>
        </ul>
