        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Colorful, sweet, refreshing, and filled with fun textures only begin to describe my all-time favorite Vietnamese dessert Che Thai. Made with jackfruit, lychees, longan, pandan jelly, and red rubies, you can taste the Southeast Asian rainbow with this crowd-pleaser dessert.</p>
        <p>Che Thai is the perfect dessert to make for events hosting large groups of people. It is lightly sweet, filled with delicious tropical fruit, and so refreshing on a hot day.</p>
