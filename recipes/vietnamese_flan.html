        <!--Description-->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Banh flan is the Vietnamese version of the French creme caramel and is known as flan in other regions. It is delicate and soft and covered in a layer of sugary caramel. Vietnamese banh flan uses condensed or evaporated milk and is steamed rather than baked in an oven.</p>
        <p>This creme caramel flan has the perfect balance of sweetness, the most delicate and velvety texture, and is possibly the best flan that has ever existed. This flan recipe is so ridiculously delicious that it was impossible for me to not share it with you.</p>
        <!--Ingredients-->
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>This Vietnamese creme caramel flan only requires 6 ingredients that you can find at your local grocery store.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Large Eggs:</strong> make sure to use large eggs at room temperature for this recipe. The eggs are what create the silky custard texture of this flan.</li>
            <li><strong>Evaporated Milk:</strong> evaporated milk is a milk that has evaporated about 60% of the water content. The result is a creamier, thicker milk. This will result in a creamier custard.</li>
            <li><strong>Water:</strong> the water slightly thins out the milk and also creates the amber caramel sauce</li>
            <li><strong>Granulated Sugar:</strong> the granulated sugar creates the rich amber caramel and sweetens the custard</li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla Extract:</strong> the vanilla extract is the main flavoring component to the custard</li>
            <li><strong>Lemon Juice:</strong> the lemon juice is added to the caramel for a touch of acidity and flavor</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This Vietnamese creme caramel flan recipe requires very few steps but each step is very important so read carefully!</p>
        <ol>
            <!--Step 1-->
            <li>
                <h4>MAKE THE CARAMEL SYRUP</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a small mixing bowl, mix together the sugar water and lemon juice. Pour the syrup into a small skillet on medium heat, until the sugar dissolves and melts into a golden amber. Do not stir! You can pick up the skillet and swirl it around 1-2 times to prevent it from burning.</li>
                    <li>Pour the caramel into the 8 inch cake pan and quickly swirl the brown sugar syrup to cover the entire bottom of the pan. The syrup will harden in a few seconds.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <!--Step 2-->
            <li>
                <h4>MAKE THE CUSTARD</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Using a fine mesh sieve over a large mixing bowl, crack the eggs over the sieve and use a fork to break up the yolk to go through the sieve. Add the vanilla extract and gently whisk slowly until combined. Try not to whisk too quickly to create any air bubbles in the mixture. Then pour in the evaporated milk, water, and sugar and slowly whisk until the sugar dissolves.</li>
                    <li>Slowly pour the flan mixture through the fine mesh sieve into the sugar cake pan. Make sure to pop any air bubbles with a tooth pick.
                    </li>
                    <li>In your steamer, fill the water until the bottom pot is Â¾ full and heat you steamer on high heat until it reaches boil. Then when it reaches a boil, turn down the heat to low or a low simmer. Place the flan in the steamer and steam for 1 hour. Place the lid on the steamer with a chopstick in the lid so that the lid is slightly open. Every 10 minutes wipe down the condensation on the lid to prevent water from dripping into the flan. The flan is done when the outer rim is set and the center has a slight jiggle.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <!--Step 3-->
            <li>
                <h4>CHILL AND REMOVE</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>When the flan is finished steaming, remove and let the flan cool until it reaches room temperature and then chill it in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours or overnight. To remove, use a pairing knife to run it along the edge of the pan. Place the plate on top of the cake pan and flip the cake pan 180 degrees. Tap the top of the cake pan a few times to release the flan. Serve immediately.</li>
