        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Banh flan is the Vietnamese version of the French creme caramel and is known as flan in other regions. It is delicate and soft and covered in a layer of sugary caramel. Vietnamese banh flan uses condensed or evaporated milk and is steamed rather than baked in an oven.</p>
        <p>This creme caramel flan has the perfect balance of sweetness, the most delicate and velvety texture, and is possibly the best flan that has ever existed. This flan recipe is so ridiculously delicious that it was impossible for me to not share it with you.</p>
